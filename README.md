# SpendCraft - A Personal Finance Application

This is the open source project behind the SpendCraft personal finance app (http2://spendcraft.app).

This is stil a work in progress but it is very functional. The site uses Plaid to acquire information from financial institutions. The site is currently using the "development" environment so it is limited in the number of users it can support at the moment.
